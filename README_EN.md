## 🛠️ Usage

### Run Manually

You can trigger the monitor script manually for testing or ad-hoc updates:

```bash
# Check all platforms
./scripts/monitor.sh all

# Check specific platform
./scripts/monitor.sh win
./scripts/monitor.sh mac
./scripts/monitor.sh android

# Check with custom URL (Platform specific)
./scripts/monitor.sh win "https://example.com/WeChat.exe"
```

### Cleanup Duplicates

If you encounter redundant releases, use the cleanup tool:

```bash
# Dry run (safe mode)
./scripts/cleanup_duplicates.py

# Execute deletion
./scripts/cleanup_duplicates.py --execute
```
